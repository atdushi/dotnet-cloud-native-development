# Getting Started

Make sure the `CarvedRock-Aspire.AppHost` project is set as the startup
project.

Run it!

> **N O T E:** The first time you run the app, it may take a little longer to start
if you don't already have the Postgres and Smtp4Dev container images downloaded.

The Aspire Dashboard will be launched and that will have links for the different
projects.  Start by clicking the link for the WebApp project!
